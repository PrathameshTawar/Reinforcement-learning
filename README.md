# AIM-Env: AI Email Triage RL Environment

AIM-Env is a lightweight, OpenEnv-compliant Reinforcement Learning execution environment where an LLM agent triages a simulated email inbox. It is designed to run as a single Python script inside a minimal Docker container and pass the Round 1 automated grader with a perfect score.

## Overview

The agent receives a simulated inbox of emails and must triage them by opening, classifying, prioritizing, routing, and detecting phishing — all within a fixed time budget. Each episode is driven by an LLM (via the OpenAI-compatible API) that reads the current inbox state and returns a JSON action.

The environment is fully deterministic: given the same seed, the same emails are always generated in the same order. This makes scoring reproducible across runs.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `HF_TOKEN` | **Yes** | — | API key passed to the OpenAI client. Raises `ValueError` immediately if missing. |
| `API_BASE_URL` | No | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | Base URL for the OpenAI-compatible API endpoint. |
| `MODEL_NAME` | No | `gpt-4o-mini` | Model identifier used for all LLM calls. |

`HF_TOKEN` is mandatory. The script will raise a `ValueError` and exit before doing any work if it is not set.

---

## Quick Start

### Run locally

```bash
export HF_TOKEN=your_token_here
export API_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1   # optional
export MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o-mini                   # optional

pip install openai pydantic
python inference.py
```

### Run with Docker

```bash
docker build -t aim-env .

docker run --rm \
  -e HF_TOKEN=your_token_here \
  -e API_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1 \
  -e MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o-mini \
  aim-env
```

## How It Works

### Episode Lifecycle

For each of the three tasks (easy → medium → hard), `inference.py` runs one full episode:

1. `AIMEnv(config)` is instantiated with the task's `TaskConfig`.
2. `env.reset()` generates a fresh inbox of emails using the fixed seed and returns the initial `Observation`.
3. `[START]` is printed to stdout.
4. The `while not done` loop runs:
   - The current `Observation` is serialized into a natural-language prompt.
   - The LLM is called via `client.chat.completions.create(...)`.
   - The response is parsed as a JSON `Action`. If parsing fails for any reason, the fallback action is `{"type": "submit"}`.
   - `env.step(action)` is called, returning `(Observation, Reward, done)`.
   - `[STEP]` is printed to stdout.
5. After the loop, `env.get_result()` computes the `EpisodeResult` and `Grader().grade_episode(result)` produces the final score.
6. `[END]` is printed to stdout.

### Action Space

The agent can issue one of four action types per step:

| Action | Required Fields | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `open` | `email_id` | Reveals the full email body; marks email as `opened`. Required before classifying. |
| `classify` | `email_id`, `category`, `priority`, `route` | Assigns category/priority/route to an opened email; marks it `processed`. |
| `detect_phishing` | `email_id` | Flags an email as phishing; marks it `processed`. |
| `submit` | — | Ends the episode immediately. |

The LLM must respond with a single JSON object, for example:

```json
{"type": "open", "email_id": "email_001"}
{"type": "classify", "email_id": "email_001", "category": "urgent", "priority": "high", "route": "escalate"}
{"type": "detect_phishing", "email_id": "email_002"}
{"type": "submit"}
```

### Observation Space

At each step the agent receives an `Observation` containing:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `inbox` | `List[EmailPartial]` | Up to 5 unread emails (id, subject, sender, preview) |
| `opened` | `List[str]` | IDs of currently opened emails |
| `time_left` | `int` | Remaining time units before timeout |
| `step_count` | `int` | Number of steps taken so far |
| `pending_emails` | `int` | Emails not yet processed |
| `alerts` | `List[str]` | Environment-level warnings |
| `classified` | `int` | Running count of correct classifications |
| `prioritized` | `int` | Running count of correct priorities |
| `routed` | `int` | Running count of correct routes |

### Reward Structure

Each step returns a `Reward` with a scalar `value` and a `components` dict breaking down the signal sources:

| Component | Value | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `step` | `-0.02` | Every step (time cost) |
| `opened` | `+0.01` | Successfully opening a new email |
| `correct_classification` | `+0.35` | Category matches ground truth |
| `correct_priority` | `+0.20` | Priority matches ground truth (requires correct category) |
| `correct_route` | `+0.20` | Route matches ground truth (requires correct category) |
| `wrong_classification` | `-0.25` | Category does not match ground truth |
| `wrong_priority` | `-0.10` | Priority wrong (category was correct) |
| `wrong_route` | `-0.10` | Route wrong (category was correct) |
| `phishing_detected` | `+0.60` | Correctly flagged phishing email |
| `phishing_detected_critical` | `+1.00` | Correctly flagged critical phishing email |
| `false_positive` | `-0.20` | Flagged a non-phishing email as phishing |
| `no_open_penalty` | `-0.15` | Tried to classify without opening first |
| `already_processed` | `-0.05` | Acted on an already-processed email |
| `invalid_action` | `-0.05` | Malformed or unknown action |
| `timeout` | `-0.50` | Time budget exhausted |
| `delay_<id>` | `-0.30` | Delayed penalty for ignoring a critical email |

### Grader & Scoring

The `Grader` computes a deterministic final score from the `EpisodeResult` using a weighted formula:

```
score = 0.30 × classification_acc
      + 0.20 × priority_acc
      + 0.20 × routing_acc
      + 0.20 × risk_score
      + 0.10 × efficiency_score
```

All component values are normalized to `[0.0, 1.0]`. The final score is clamped to `[0.0, 1.0]`.

An episode is considered a **success** if `score >= 0.5`.

## Task Configurations

Three tasks are defined with fixed seeds for full reproducibility:

| Task | Seed | Emails | Time Budget | Ambiguity | Phishing | Time Pressure |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `easy` | 42 | 3 | 20 | 0.0 | No | 0.0 |
| `medium` | 137 | 7 | 30 | 0.2 | Yes | 0.1 |
| `hard` | 999 | 12 | 40 | 0.5 | Yes | 0.5 |

- **Ambiguity level**: probability that email context fields are partially missing, making classification harder.
- **Has phishing**: whether adversarial phishing emails are injected into the inbox.
- **Time pressure**: multiplier applied to step cost — higher values drain the time budget faster.

---

## Stdout Format Contract

The grader parses stdout line-by-line. Every line must match exactly:

### `[START]`
```
[START] task=<task_name> env=<benchmark> model=<model_name>
```
Example:
```
[START] task=easy env=aim-email-triage model=gpt-4o-mini
```

### `[STEP]`
```
[STEP] step=<n> action=<action_str> reward=<0.00> done=<true|false> error=<msg|null>
```
- `reward` is always formatted to **exactly 2 decimal places**
- `done` is always lowercase `true` or `false`
- `error` is the literal string `null` when no error occurred, or the exception message string when an LLM/parse error happened
- `action_str` is `<type>` or `<type>:<email_id>` for actions targeting an email

Example:
```
[STEP] step=0 action=open:email_001 reward=-0.01 done=false error=null
[STEP] step=1 action=classify:email_001 reward=0.73 done=false error=null
[STEP] step=2 action=submit reward=-0.02 done=true error=null
```

### `[END]`
```
[END] success=<true|false> steps=<n> rewards=<r1,r2,...rn>
```
- `success` is lowercase `true` or `false`
- `rewards` is a comma-separated list of all per-step reward values, each to **exactly 2 decimal places**, no spaces

Example:
```
[END] success=true steps=3 rewards=-0.01,0.73,-0.02
```

## Data Models

All models are Pydantic v2 and live in `env/models.py`.

### `TaskConfig`
```python

    ambiguity_level: float # 0.0–1.0 noise on email context
    has_phishing: bool     # inject phishing emails
    time_pressure: float   # step cost multiplier
```

### `Observation`
```python

```

### `Reward`
```python
class Reward(BaseModel):
    value: float                  # scalar step reward
    components: Dict[str, float]  # breakdown by cause
```

### `EpisodeResult`
```python
class EpisodeResult(BaseModel):
    score: float
    steps: int
    correct_classifications: int
    phishing_detected: int
    efficiency: float
    classification_acc: float   # correct_classifications / total_emails
    priority_acc: float         # correct_priorities / total_emails
    routing_acc: float          # correct_routes / total_emails
    risk_score: float           # phishing_detected / total_phishing
    efficiency_score: float     # 1 - (steps / (time_budget * 2))
```

## Docker

The `Dockerfile` is intentionally minimal:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["python", "inference.py"]
```

`requirements.txt`:
```
openai
pydantic
```

No Node.js, no npm, no React, no FastAPI, no build tools. The image installs only what is needed to run `inference.py`.

Resource footprint is well within the Hugging Face container limits of 2 vCPU / 8 GB RAM.
